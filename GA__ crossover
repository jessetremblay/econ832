# I just did a rough sketch of when crossover will occur but the function itself needs heavy work including actually making crossover happen

def crossover(crossover_probability):
  offspring = []
  for i in GA.firm:
    chance = random.uniform(0,1)
    print(chance)
    if chance < crossover_probability:
      print("Crossover will occur")
    else:
      print("Crossover will not occur")
