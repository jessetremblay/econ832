# Econ 832
I split things up in order to make them more readable. Many parts of the code have been "started" in the main program, 
but do not actually fulfill a purpose. I left blank documents here because we might as well start from scratch.

Once we finish the generic GA, then we can do more fancy stuff. I recommend pip installing matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn if you haven't already
Numpy is necessary and SciPy is useful as well.

You'll notice that there are a couple benchmark files. As we build our engine up, it might run more slowly if we do not watch our benchmark times. The code in those files is pretty self-explanatory but you can run it once to see what it does. 0's just means that it took no time at all to run the code! I doubt he teaches our class about code efficiency and benchmarking, but it's a useful tool to have in your toolbox

Woo! Genetic Algorithms
