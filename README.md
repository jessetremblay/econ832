I split things up in order to make them more readable. Many parts of the code have been "started" in the main program, 
but do not actually fulfill a purpose. I left blank documents here because we might as well start from scratch.

Once we finish the generic GA, then we can do more fancy stuff. I recommend pip installing matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn if you haven't already
Numpy is necessary and SciPy is useful as well.

Woo! Genetic Algorithms
